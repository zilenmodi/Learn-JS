//Why Webpack?
/*
This big file is called a "bundle" in Webpack parlance. A module bundler then is something which collating lots of small pieces into something larger and self-contained.

The powerful ecosystem of Webpack plugins and extras makes Webpack seem confusing as it appears to do so much. All the extra things such as compiling ES6/7 to ES5, CSS modules and code splitting are just nice extras afforded to us by Webpack.
